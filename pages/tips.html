    <h6>The best password tips from the pros</h6>
    <ul>
    <li><p>1     - Always use a unique password for each account you create. The danger with reusing passwords is that as soon as one site has a security issue, it‘s very easy for hackers to try the same username and password combination on other websites.</p></li>
    <li><p>2     - Don’t use any personally identifiable information in your passwords. Names, birthdays, and street addresses may be easy to remember but they’re also easily found online and should always be avoided in passwords to ensure the greatest strength.</p></li>
    <li><p>3     - Make sure your passwords are at least 12 characters long and contain letters, numbers, and special characters. Some people prefer to generate passwords which are 14 or 20 characters in length.</p></li>
    <li><p>4     - If you’re creating a master password that you’ll need to remember, try using phrases or lyrics from your favorite movie or song. Just add random characters, but don't replace them in easy patterns.</p></li>
    <li><p>5     - It's recommended that you remember a few master passwords, store other passwords in a plain text file and encrypt this file with 7-Zip, GPG or a disk encryption software such as BitLocker, or manage your passwords with a password management software.</p></li>
    <li><p>6     - Avoid weak, commonly used passwords like asd123, password1, or Temp!. Some examples of a strong password include: S&2x4S12nLS1*, JANa@sx3l2&s$, 49915w5$oYmH.</p></li>
    <li><p>7     - Avoid using personal information for your security questions.</p></li>
    <li><p>8     - Avoid using similar passwords that change only a single word or character. This practice weakens your account security across multiple sites.</p></li>
    <li><p>9     - Change your passwords when you have reason to , such as after you've shared them with someone, after a website has had a breach, or if it's been over a year since you last rotated it.</p></li>
    <li><p>10    - You should never share your passwords via email or text message.</p></li>
